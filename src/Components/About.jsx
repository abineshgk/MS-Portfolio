      <p>
        I’m <strong>Abinesh G K</strong>, a passionate and enthusiastic 
        <strong>Full Stack MERN Developer</strong> and BCA graduate. 
        As a fresher, I have developed a strong foundation in frontend and backend development 
        through academic learning and hands-on projects.
       </p>

      <p>
        I have experience working with <strong>React.js</strong> to build responsive and modern user interfaces 
        and <strong>Node.js</strong> to develop backend APIs. 
        I am also familiar with <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong> 
        for database design and integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently seeking an entry-level opportunity where I can apply my skills, 
        continue learning from experienced professionals, and contribute to meaningful 
        and innovative software solutions.
